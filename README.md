# Exercise in Go

## Questions

1. Implement a stack data structure using two queues.
 
2. Write a function that takes the current directory path and a target path and returns an absolute path that is equivalent to the target path. 
E.g. current directory /home/andy, target ./bin/foo, absolute /home/andy/bin/foo 
 
3. Find the duplicates integers in a large array. Array with integers from 1-1,000,000.
 
4. Given a binary tree, determine if the tree is balance.
 
5.  Return all possible valid IP addresses given a string containing only digits. 
E.g. "25525510124" ["255.255.10.124", "255.255.101.24"]

## Run

For each question, the code of implementation is in the package folder as well as a main function outside. I have already put some use cases in main functions and you can directly run them. You can also add more cases in main. 

`git clone git@github.com:andyweicao/goExercise.git`

`cd exercise1`

`go run main.go`
